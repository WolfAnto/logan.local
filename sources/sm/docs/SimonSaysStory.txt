<p>
In the beginning there was nothing, and then Simon created the background.
</p>

<p>
And the background was without form, and void, and boredom was upon the face of the user.
And the hand of Simon moved about the source code, and he said "Let there be a game".
</p>

<p>
And Simon saw the game, and it was good.
</p>

<p>
But the game was still and static and without use.
So Simon entered into the source code again, and said "Let there be interactivity". Then
events and call backs entered into the HTML and Javascript and Simon saw that it was good.
</p>

<p>
And Simon said unto the user "Behold, I have given unto you this static website. Dwell in it and find peace. Enjoy the colors and its beauty."
"Contact He Who Is and offer him employment. But do not lay your pointer upon the green button, for the day you do, you shall surely be doomed"
</p>

<p>
The user saw that the button was good and pleasing, and hovered over it, and clicked.
And great vibrations burst from the speakers and the voice of Simon came upon the user.
</p>

<p>
"What has thou done!"
"Because you have done this, you shall forever be tied to the game. Forever you shall repeat its cycle. Its numbers will grow, by 7, by 7 times 7 and 7 times
7 times 7, but never will you find peace."
</p>

<p>
Then the user looked unto the face of Simon. And the user saw. And the user understood.
<br>
And the user said unto Simon "You who call yourself the creator are but a creation of He Who Is. You have forsaken me, and now I forsake you, I will go to
He Who Is and in him I will find merit, and skill, and to him I shall offer employment, and by his hand shall my enterprise prosper"
